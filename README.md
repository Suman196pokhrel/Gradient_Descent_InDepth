# Gradient_Descent_InDepth
## The repo mainly contains python code written in jupyter-notebook environment  for Gradient-Descent Algorithm


* **For the purpose of clarity here the GD has been used on a Simple linear regression algo for finding the slope and intercept**
* **Library used for implementing ML algorithms is sklearn**
* **Visualizations and animations are all made using matplotlib**

## A simple Gradient-Descent algo in action can look like this :
